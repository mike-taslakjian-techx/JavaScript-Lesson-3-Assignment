# JavaScript: Lesson 3 Assignment

Assignment: Counter and Form Validation

Files to submit:

index.html

main.js

counter.js

Part A: Counter Module

In counter.js, create a count variable and only export 2 helper functions to update it (increment, reset):

Part B: Page Interaction

Build a basic page in index.html. Handle logic in main.js.

The page should:

Display the current count

Have two buttons: Increment and Reset

Include a form with a text input and a submit button

When the form is submitted:

If the input has at least 3 characters, show a welcome message below the form

If not, show an error message in red below the input

Clear the input if valid

NOTE: Don't make anything look pretty, CSS is not important here.
